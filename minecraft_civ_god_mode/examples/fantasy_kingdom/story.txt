A majestic white castle stands at the center of the kingdom, with four tall towers reaching towards the sky. Each tower is 30 blocks high, topped with red cone-shaped roofs. The castle walls are made of white concrete and stone bricks, with large wooden doors guarding the entrance.

Around the castle, a medieval village spreads out with cobblestone roads connecting wooden houses. The village includes a blacksmith shop with a smoking chimney, a marketplace with colorful stalls, a church with a bell tower, farmlands with wheat and carrots, and a stone bridge over a river.

The entire kingdom is surrounded by a protective stone wall with watchtowers at each corner.
